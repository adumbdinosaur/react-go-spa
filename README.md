# Running the Applications

To run both the Go server and the React application concurrently, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:
   - [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
   - [Node.js and yarn](https://nodejs.org/)

2. Make the `run-apps.sh` script executable (if not already):
```bash
chmod +x run-apps.sh
```
